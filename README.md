# Horiseon Update Challenge

## Description

Horiseon is a Reputation Management company that was in need of improved webpage accessibility to both provide accessibility to all users as well as optimize its content for search engines. This project was created with that goal in mind, adding alt text to images, transitioning to use of semantic HTML elements and restructuring elements to fall in a logical order. 

This project was key in helping me to understand semantic HTML and small changes that can improve a webpage's accessibility.
